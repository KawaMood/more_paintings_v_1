/!\ This data pack is now outdated.

If you want to get the most recent version, please visit: https://www.planetminecraft.com/data-pack/more-paintings-no-resources-pack-or-mod/

## How to install?

To make it easier, watch the [tutorial video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STI7hG3Giz0). If you don't want to, you can read the following text version:

### For Single Player

1. Go to your world's save folder (located in "AppData\Roaming\.minecraft\saves\<your_world_name>\") *
2. Copy all files that are in "PK_More_Painting_1.0.1_Data\" to your world's "data\" folder.
3. Copy "PK_More_Painting_1.0.1_Datapack" and paste it in your world's "datapacks\" folder.
4. You can start to use those new paintings on your world.

If you don't know how to reach your AppData folder, press on your keyboard the Windows symbol + letter R to open the executor, and tip "%appdata%", then press "Ok".
Otherwise, you can also access your world folder from the game : Single Player -> select your world -> Click the "Edit" button -> Click "Open world folder".

### For Server

The process is the same, only difference being that you'll probably need FTP access to get the world's folder of your server.
You'll also need to restart the server after the process.
